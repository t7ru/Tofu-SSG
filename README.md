# Tofu's SSG
Tofu's Static Site Generator, this is an abandoned project of mine.

What it does is builds a blog site from markdown files with various features on a standard blog. This is an extremely old project of mine from around a year ago, I've decided to clean it up and replace a few things with placeholders in order make it public.
